	<h1>Automated Testing Project for Shichor Website</h1>
	<p>This project is an automated testing project designed to test the "Shichor" website, using the following technologies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Page Object Model</li>
		<li>Base Page</li>
		<li>PageFactory</li>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>Selenium</li>
		<li>TestNG</li>
		<li>Project Object Model (POM)</li>
		<li>Maven</li>
		<li>Allure</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Page Object Model is a design pattern used to create a useful and reusable code for testing user interfaces. The Base Page is a file that contains methods and variables that are common to all pages. The PageFactory is a Selenium class that is used to initialize elements of a Page Object.</p>
	<h2>Project Structure</h2>
	<p>The project is structured as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>src/main/java</code> directory contains the source code of the project, including the Page Object Model classes and Base Page class.</li>
		<li><code>src/main/resources</code> directory contains the configuration files.</li>
		<li><code>src/test/java</code> directory contains the automated tests for the project.</li>
		<li><code>src/test/resources</code> directory contains the test data for the automated tests.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Running the Tests</h2>
	<p>To run the tests, follow these steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Clone the repository.</li>
		<li>Install the necessary dependencies using Maven.</li>
		<li>Run the tests using the <code>testng.xml</code> file in the <code>src/test/resources</code> directory.</li>
		<li>View the test results in the Allure report that is generated after the tests are run.</li>
	</ol>
